<p>As it turns out, it is not so nice to have easily removable microcontroller connections on a keyboard. The jumper cables kept coming off, which was a nightmare for typing.</p>
<p>So I had done a second version, which I didn’t write about, because I thought it was too similar to the first.</p>
<p>Basically all I did was add a small breadboard for the microcontroller to sit on, and which held the connections more steadily. But that was about it.</p>
<p>Now, even this iteration of Hackie (as my wife and I affectionately named the Redox Handwire) started getting very flaky. Keys would randomly fail, and sometimes just get disconnected. This was very irritating, and eventually got to a point where I decided I needed to address this.</p>
<h2 id="new-plan">New plan</h2>
<p>So my new plan for this update of Hackie was two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I had learned some lessons from the previous rounds of building Hackie. One of the biggest problems I faced was that keys would randomly disconnect, and I suspected it was because the wire connections were coming loose. So, this time I would tightly connect the wires before soldering them.</li>
<li>I realized that a moving part outside of the keyboard meant a lot more problem, so I wanted to be able to fit the microcontroller into the case.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="better-wire-connections">Better wire connections</h2>
<p>The first part was not so hard, but very tedious. I basically had to wind the wires around each other before soldering them, which was very cumbersome and such fine work.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/assets/blog/2024_11_19_Redox_Handwire_v3/WiringCloseUp.jpeg" alt="WiringCloseUp.jpeg"></p>
<p>I also decided to do all the rows at once, which would sit closer to the plate, and therefore could be done first.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/assets/blog/2024_11_19_Redox_Handwire_v3/WiringRows.jpeg" alt="WiringRows.jpeg"></p>
<p>I don’t know if this will solve all the problems, but I do expect to get fewer of the same sort of issue arising from loose solder.</p>
<h2 id="microcontroller-placement">Microcontroller placement</h2>
<p>I figured the best place to put the microcontroller would be inside the case. This was not so much of a problem, but it did mean I needed some way for the microcontroller to sit securely when plugging in, or removing the cable.</p>
<p>In the end I decided I would just melt a channel into the case, since it was a 3D Printed case.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/assets/blog/2024_11_19_Redox_Handwire_v3/MicrocontrollerNewSlot.jpeg" alt="MicrocontrollerNewSlot.jpeg"></p>
<p>This turned out okay, and the microcontroller could sit almost flush to the case.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/assets/blog/2024_11_19_Redox_Handwire_v3/MicrocontrollerCloseUp.jpeg" alt="MicrocontrollerCloseUp.jpeg"></p>
<p>This wasn’t the prettiest, but it was quite easily doable, and it worked.</p>
<h2 id="finished-v3">Finished v3</h2>
<p>So finally I finished all the wiring! This round was a lot neater than previous rounds. I decided to mix wires this time, instead of using only single core wires. Instead, I used some Ribbon cables for connections between the keyboard matrix and the microcontroller, which lent a lot more flexibility when the case is closed.</p>

<h2 id="some-trouble-with-qmk">Some trouble with QMK</h2>
<p>I had a little trouble with QMK too. For one thing, I forgot the steps needed to flash the firmware correctly to both sides.</p>
<p>As it turns out, I could use QMK Toolbox, but I could not use the <code>.hex</code> file compiled by QMK Configurator. That’s because I needed <code>EE_HANDS</code> defined, and this had to be done in the C code itself.</p>
<p>But once that as done, I could just flash the EEPROM for left and right hands, and then flash the compiled <code>.hex</code>.</p>
<p>This worked just fine, and I’m now typing this on my new and improved Hackie v3. I do have plans for Hackie v4, but it’s still in the works, so I’ll share it when it’s ready</p> </div> </article> </main>  </main> <footer data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <div class="links-container" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <div class="links-section" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <p data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte>Connect With Me</p> <div class="icons" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <a href="https://github.com/julwrites/julwrites.github.io/raw/master/assets/resume/Resume_Julian_Teh.pdf" target="_blank" title="Resume" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <img src="/assets/images/dark/resume.png" alt="Resume" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <span data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte>Resume</span> </a> <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/julwrites" target="_blank" title="LinkedIn" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <img src="/assets/images/dark/linkedin.png" alt="LinkedIn" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <span data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte>LinkedIn</span> </a> <a href="mailto:contact@tehj.io" target="_blank" title="Email" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <img src="/assets/images/dark/email.png" alt="Email" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <span data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte>Email</span> </a> </div> </div> </div> <p data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte>&copy; 2025 Julian Teh.
