I had previously set up NextCloud on a Raspberry Pi, so that had to be modified to allow the new server with `nginx` to handle the reverse proxy for all devices behind the IP address. \\n\\nI set up the `nginx.conf` to listen on Port 443, and did some [configuration](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-centos-7) to perform a `proxy_pass` to the other servers involved. This proved tricky when it came to SSL certification; LetsEncrypt required that the custom domain being specified for SSL certification be accessible and responsive, which led to a number of retries and that in turn led to a number of failed attempts, which... Had some [rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/) that made it quite a pain to get working.\\n\\nI then added an A record to my subdomain, and pointed it to my public IP address, added port forwarding on my router to my device for `http` and `https` access, and... Poof, went my Cockpit access. I had managed to cause Cockpit's SSL cert to be replaced. This was, fortunately, easily resolved by SSH-ing into the client and re-running `certbot` to [replace the certificate](https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/fedora-nginx). \\n\\nSome debugging on whether `nginx` was actually listening to Port 443 told me that it was.\\n```\\n# netstat -anop | grep LISTEN | grep nginx\\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:443             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1049/nginx: master   off (0.00/0/0)\\n```\\n\\nI made sure `certbot` was [registering my certificates and keys](https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/fedora-nginx) properly before proceeding, but this still didn't get me access through my custom domain. This did allow me though, to get past the rate limits since I now had valid certificates that did not need to be renewed, simply used. This was done by setting up my `nginx.conf` such that each server had it's own SSL configuration.\\n\\n```\\nserver {\\n    listen       443 ssl;\\n\\n    server_name  <custom domain>;\\n\\n    ssl_certificate         /etc/letsencrypt/live/<custom domain>/cert.pem;\\n    ssl_certificate_key     /etc/letsencrypt/live/<custom domain>/privkey.pem;\\n\\n    access_log              /var/log/nginx/<custom domain>.access.log;\\n    error_log               /var/log/nginx/<custom domain>.error.log;\\n\\n    location / {\\n        proxy_pass                http://localhost:8080;\\n        proxy_redirect            http://localhost:8080 https://<custom domain>;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNext I had to make sure the firewall wasn't blocking my ports. This was fairly easy to do with Cockpit, and I was able to quickly check that the service was enabling Port access for 443.\\n\\n![CockpitFirewall.png](../assets/blog/2020_08_16_Nginx_Server/CockpitFirewall.png)\\n\\nAnother thing to check was that SELinux wasn't blocking something that docker needed to access the network, so after some [searching](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23948527/13-permission-denied-while-connecting-to-upstreamnginx)...\\n\\n```\\nsetsebool httpd_can_network_connect on -P\\n```\\n\\nFinally I found that `nginx` was running as root, but that `nginx.conf` had set the user field to `nginx` instead of `root`. Once this was toggled, access to my code server was enabled, and I could see the login page. \\n\\n![CodeTehjIo.png](../assets/blog/2020_08_16_Nginx_Server/CodeTehjIo.png)\\n\\nThis had one last issue, which was that while the login page displayed, and I could log in, code-server didn't load. Opening the console window showed a whole bunch of `websocket` errors, and upon some research, I found that this was because `nginx` needed to pass more [proxy header information](https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/979#issuecomment-337934638) to docker than it was already doing (it was receiving a success code back that it didn't know how to handle)\\n\\n```\\nlocation / {\\n    proxy_pass         http://localhost:8080;\\n    proxy_http_version 1.1;\\n    proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;\\n    proxy_set_header   Connection \\\"upgrade\\\";\\n    proxy_set_header   Host $host;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nOnce this was done, everything worked, and code-server was accessible from the browser through my custom domain. \\n\\n![CodeServer.png](../assets/blog/2020_08_16_Nginx_Server/CodeServer.png)\\n\"}"},"path":"projects/2020_08_16_Nginx_Server"}
