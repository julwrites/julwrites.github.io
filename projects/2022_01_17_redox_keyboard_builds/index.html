Some time in September 2021, my wife remarked that she also wanted a split keyboard, and that sparked in me what might be called a hacker’s burning desire to build the thing.</p>
<h2 id="ordering-the-parts">Ordering the parts</h2>
<p>Now, I knew that split keyboard were difficult to find. In our little search, we found that if we wanted to buy a customized set which was programmable (the only kind of split keyboard which makes sense), it would set us back some $600 SGD per set.</p>
<p>Obviously we balked at the cost, and so I said I’d build it, and better yet, I’d build a prototype first so we could try the keyboard layout before actually spending more money on it.</p>
<p>About $200 SGD later, I had bought enough switches for 3.25 keyboards, enough hotswap sockets for 3, TRRS jacks and diodes for 6, and so on… I went a little crazy there.</p>
<p>I got a friend to help me 3d print the cases for the prototype, and after he sent them over, I gave it a little test fitting.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/assets/blog/2022_01_17_Redox_Keyboard_Builds/Test_Fitting.jpg" alt="Test_Fitting.jpg"></p>
<p>With a little more research we confirmed that we wanted the Redox keyboard for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There was enough <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/160610-redox-keyboard/log/151316-redox-handwire">documentation</a> on it</li>
<li>It was viable to buy parts for it (keycaps and cases were especially tricky to find)</li>
<li>It was a design where either side could be the master</li>
</ul>
<p>So we ordered some cases and PCBs from <a href="https://falba.tech/">FalbaTech</a> and keycap sets from <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33006060286.html">Aliexpress</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/blog/2022_01_17_Redox_Keyboard_Builds/Wooden_Case.jpg" alt="Wooden_Case.jpg"></p>
<p>Funny enough, I delayed the hand-wiring so long that the cases and PCBs that we ordered arrived before I had finished hand-wiring. So we went ahead and started on those first, and finished them over a weekend. It wasn’t difficult to solder in the hot swap sockets, but it did give me a couple of lessons in managing the microcontrollers and working with QMK.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t solder until you absolutely have to</li>
<li>Read the documentation carefully before making any permanent decisions</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, I made some mistakes, and cost myself a little. It took me awhile to figure out that on a Windows machine, the COM Ports would appear only for a moment on a microcontroller that was already a USB host. Shortly after I figured out that I had soldered my right microcontroller upside down.</p>
<p>Other than that, configuring a keyboard layout flashing the microcontrollers was simple enough using <a href="https://config.qmk.fm/#/">QMK Configurator</a> and following <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/">QMK Documentation</a></p>
<p>The end result: My wife and I both got new split keyboards for the price of one Ergodox.</p>

<h2 id="hand-wiring-a-keyboard">Hand-wiring a keyboard</h2>
<p>I then realized that I did want a second keyboard to bring to the office, so I figured I would finish my hand-wiring. This took me longer than both other keyboards combined, partly because I wanted to use the hotswap switches, and partly because stripping little sections of wire is very time-consuming.</p>

Once all those were done though, it was a simple matter to assemble the pieces, and since I had already experienced the trouble with QMK, that was no issue either.</p>
<p>I debated for a while on whether to keep the microcontrollers inside the case, but my wife commented that it looks nice outside, and I kind of agree (we named it Hackie, and the look sort of fits the name).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/assets/blog/2022_01_17_Redox_Keyboard_Builds/Working_Prototype.jpg" alt="Working_Prototype.jpg"></p>
<p>Overall the experience of building the three keyboards was really quite tiring but also very rewarding. There’s something about being able to use the thing you’ve made everyday; plus it looks good and is enjoyable to use.</p> </div> </article> </main>  </main> <footer data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <div class="links-container" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <div class="links-section" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <p data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte>Connect With Me</p> <div class="icons" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <a href="https://github.com/julwrites/julwrites.github.io/raw/master/assets/resume/Resume_Julian_Teh.pdf" target="_blank" title="Resume" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <img src="/assets/images/dark/resume.png" alt="Resume" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <span data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte>Resume</span> </a> <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/julwrites" target="_blank" title="LinkedIn" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <img src="/assets/images/dark/linkedin.png" alt="LinkedIn" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <span data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte>LinkedIn</span> </a> <a href="mailto:contact@tehj.io" target="_blank" title="Email" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <img src="/assets/images/dark/email.png" alt="Email" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <span data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte>Email</span> </a> </div> </div> </div> <p data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte>&copy; 2025 Julian Teh.
