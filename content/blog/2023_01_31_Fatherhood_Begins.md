# Fatherhood Begins

Among the many, many things I want to do, writing has always been at the top. Problem is, I have never had much to write about. Perhaps now I do, so here I am.

Yesterday my first child - Ava - was born, and many people wished us well and some who have gone before us - my own mother included - commented; "Fatherhood begins!".

As I reflected, I feel like Fatherhood began when Ava was conceived. 

I have often been said to be emotionless - jokingly, of course - because my reactions to supposedly emotional moments are rather bland. My wife will testify that while she was weeping at the altar, I simply grinned and continued the ceremony. 

But as I was in the operating theater watching the doctor tease a surprisingly white, tiny, bottom out of a gaping hole in my wife's womb, I couldn't help but wonder if I was indeed emotionless - especially compared to the other new father I saw weeping his way out of an adjacent theater. 

The truth is, I already felt like a father long before seeing Ava in the flesh. From the moment I saw the positive pregnancy test, something in my own identity began to change. 

At times, I wondered; if we had a miscarriage, would I still be a father? There are different opinions to this question, of course, but I am of the opinion that I would; only I would be a father to a child who had passed on far earlier than anyone would have wished.

And so Fatherhood began many months ago, and with every obstetrician visit, with every purchase of a baby item, with every class we attended and book we read, my identity as a Father has become more solid.

This is my theory: I posit that identity is formed very much in this way; firstly conceived by our initial awareness of a characteristic of which we desire permanence, and then made real by our intentional action to make that permanence real.

I am a father. I say this not because I impregnated my wife, but because we decided that we wanted a child. Thus, we chose to begin the journey of pregnancy, and continued to shape that identity by preparing our home and items for the baby, and acquiring relevant knowledge.
