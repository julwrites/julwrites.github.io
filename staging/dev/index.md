## Brief
Development tools are an important part of any workflow, and even more so when working on multiple platforms. To cater for a more seamless experience across platforms, a bootstrap is a useful script that helps bring the machine up to par with recommended tools. 

## Usage
1. Download `deploy.bat` for Windows or `deploy.sh` for *nix
2. Run the script (You may have to `chmod 777 deploy.sh`)

## Mantra
1. Development Tools are an essential part of any workflow
2. Developers should struggle with code, not tools
3. Good tools enable and enhance developers
