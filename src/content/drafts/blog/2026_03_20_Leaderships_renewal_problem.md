The renewal of leaders has been a particular interest of mine in recent years. I would like to say it is because I matured, but it is probably more motivated by having observed and participated in organizations where incumbent leaders fail to successfully replace themselves.

Before taking a stance on the issue, I first want to recognize that succession is a very complex concept. In order to succeed, there must be

 1. Candidates who have demonstrated sufficient capability, loyalty, and future potential.
 2. A significant level of trust and respect between the incumbent leader, and these candidates.
 3. A real willingness - even desire - for the incumbent leader to relinquish their position.

Where does it fail?

It seems at first glance that the incumbent leader is to blame, but it is not quite as simple as that. The only part of this that the incumbent leader is actually in control of is themselves, after all.

Certainly, pride may keep a leader from stepping down - and we see so much of that today - but it is only one part of the problem. Perhaps it is the least of the three problems.

Can an incumbent leader identify suitable candidates and groom them till they are ready?

It is not a simple matter, even with the best of intentions, to identify, engage, and groom candidates to succeed yourself. And you may find that you have only made them capable enough to leave rather than succeed you.

Can the candidate wait patiently and humbly for the incumbent leader to pass the baton?

In the case that the candidate does desire your position, it is not a simple matter to make them ready while keeping them humble. The same pride that keeps an incumbent leader in power drives another to take power.

## The Successor’s Paradox

We often treat succession as a search for a "suitable" candidate, as if we are looking for a missing puzzle piece. But the reality of high-performance leadership introduces a fundamental paradox: the very traits that make someone a great successor also make them the most likely to leave.

A truly driven successor is defined by two traits: **Passion** and **Opinion**.

### 1. The Entropy of Passion
Passion is contagious, but it is also corrosive in a mediocre environment. A driven, passionate leader cannot coexist for long with a dispassionate organization. If the quality of the organization as a whole has stagnated, the successor won't wait for the baton—they will leave to find (or build) an environment that matches their frequency. Org quality isn't just a recruiting tool; it is the "containment field" for succession.

### 2. Ownership vs. Stewardship
Strong opinions drive a leader toward **Ownership** rather than **Stewardship**. If I am opinionated about the "How" and the "Why," why would I settle for merely stewarding someone else's legacy? The successor often craves both the *authority* to act and the *autonomy* to create. 

This is the ultimate test for the incumbent: Can you provide a mission so large and an alignment so deep that the successor believes starting their own organization would actually be a *step down* in impact? 

## The Solution: Stewardship over Legacy

Ultimately, the only variable an incumbent leader truly controls is their own willingness to let go. This requires a fundamental mindset shift—one that aligns with the highest levels of leadership: moving from a focus on **Legacy** to a focus on **Stewardship**.

When we focus on legacy, we are often trying to preserve ourselves through the organization. We seek a successor who is a clone, someone who will protect what we built exactly as we built it. This creates the "loyalty paradox," where we accidentally select for compliance over capability.

Stewardship, however, recognizes that the organization does not belong to the leader. A steward’s job is to prepare the "house" for the next occupant and then hand over the keys. This means accepting the risk that the next leader will do things differently. It means trusting the mission enough to let it evolve beyond our own shadow.

The ultimate measure of leadership isn't what we built while we were there—it's whether what we built is healthy enough to survive our departure. Renewal isn't about finding a perfect replacement; it's about the courage to exit and the humility to trust the next steward.
