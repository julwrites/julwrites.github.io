Many of the leaders around me are perpetually exhausted. This seems to be part of the burden of leadership; a leader shoulders many burdens, and a servant leader - the penultimate kind of Christian leader - shoulders even more.

This seems like a problem to me. A leader bears many burdens, and thus is exhausted. A leader who is exhausted is expected to still bear many burdens. Is this not a vicious cycle?

What happens when a leader continues to lead while exhausted?

Granted, leaders must have greater capacity than their followers if they are to inspire and to set the pace. But this does not make the leader infallible or invincible, and many greater men have fallen for reasons far lesser than their missions.
