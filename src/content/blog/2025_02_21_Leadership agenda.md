You will probably have noticed this before. A superior pushes for something To be done - or not done - even though they have received feedback from their team that an alternative is better. It quickly becomes clear that they have an agenda behind their dictate, and it is not obvious to the team that this is for the better.

Iâ€™ve certainly been on the receiving end of these dictates before. As an engineer - and a good engineer always suggests the most logical option - it is quite common that our advice is not adopted.

Is this a fault of the leader? It really depends. I used to think that choosing to ignore truthful insight from the team is ultimately a leadership failing. But as I moved increasingly into leadership positions, I see that there is more to it.

A common area of disconnect between the leader and the team is simply information. What you know affects what you do, especially if you are a logical, reasonable type of person.
