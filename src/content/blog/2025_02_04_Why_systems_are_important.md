To me, systems have a certain beauty. A well-designed system is akin to art (and indeed some characterize architecture as exactly a discipline that bridges art and science).

But few people adopt a system just for the sake of its beauty.

The reason systems exist is firstly for their functionality; they enable something that was not possible, or enhance something that was possible. A system of pulleys, for example, both enhance the lifting capacity of a person, and potentially enable the person to lift a load much higher than they can reach.

This is important especially in engineering - many things exist today only because their underlying systems were first created - but as I reflect on leadership, I think this truth is important as well to organizations.
