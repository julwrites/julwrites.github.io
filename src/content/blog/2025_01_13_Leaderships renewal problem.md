The renewal of leaders has been a particular interest of mine in recent years. I would like to say it is because I matured, but it is probably more motivated by having observed and participated in organizations where incumbent leaders fail to successfully replace themselves.

Before taking a stance on the issue, I first want to recognize that succession is a very complex concept. In order to succeed, there must be

 1. Candidates who have demonstrated sufficient capability, loyalty, and future potential.
 2. A significant level of trust and respect between the incumbent leader, and these candidates.
 3. A real willingness - even desire - for the incumbent leader to relinquish their position.

Where does it fail?

It seems at first glance that the incumbent leader is to blame, but it is not quite as simple as that. The only part of this that the incumbent leader is actually in control of is themselves, after all.

Certainly, pride may keep a leader from stepping down - and we see so much of that today - but it is only one part of the problem. Perhaps it is the least of the three problems.

Can an incumbent leader identify suitable candidates and groom them till they are ready?

It is not a simple matter, even with the best of intentions, to identify, engage, and groom candidates to succeed yourself. And you may find that you have only made them capable enough to leave rather than succeed you.

Can the candidate wait patiently and humbly for the incumbent leader to pass the baton?

In the case that the candidate does desire your position, it is not a simple matter to make them ready while keeping them humble. The same pride that keeps an incumbent leader in power drives another to take power.
