# Added a Markdown blog to my VueJS site

So I've been a C++ application developer for 7 years, and despite my forays into the web stack, I cannot say I'm an expert at it. Nonetheless, I had gone through the process of creating my landing page in plain HTML/CSS, followed by Github Pages in Jekyll, and then finally utilizing VueJS. 

I wanted then to add a blog component to my site, just for me to do write-ups on things I think are interesting enough for me to want to consolidate my knowledge on them and keep them around (not just in my head).

After some research, I ruled out ButterCMS (which Vue recommends) because I wasn't thinking of handling a large volume of posts. The secondary recommendation was Nuxtent, which seemed like it was what I wanted at first, but by the time I managed to get it working, proved to be somewhat incompatible with my existing site.

So a little more research later, here we are. I found a great walkthrough by [Yev](https://dev.to/vycoder/creating-a-simple-blog-using-vue-with-markdown-2omd) and followed it to get this up and running. 

The plan is to start populating this blog every once in awhile with exposition on technical things, or documentation on my mini-projects, just as a way for me to force myself to consolidate my knowledge and keep track of it.
