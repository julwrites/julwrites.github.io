I don't mean this to be a journal entry, but I've been feeling cognitively fragmented recently. By which I mean that my attention span is shorter, my priorities are muddled, and my focus is shattered.

This is not a problem unique to me, but it is a problem with major consequences on lived experience; you cannot have experienced - to the extent available to you - if your mind is elsewhere. Or as my mum liked to say as I muddled my way through my piano lessons, you are not really here.

In this respect, I have personally found writing to be a wonderful catalyst. It focuses my thoughts in a way that nothing else does, and clarifies them for myself (and hopefully others). The very effort of grabbing a thought and attempting to manifest it in word seems to give it a form. And then we can get to work.

So, here I am, not for the first time, but hopefully for some time.
