description: In many ways, leaders must be explorers.

In many ways, leaders must be explorers. A leader who stays put can only gather others around them with themselves as the goal. I don't mean this to be negative - there are good reasons to gather others to oneself - but often this does not end well.

Conversely, not every explorer is a leader. Surely an explorer is a pioneer - going where few or none have gone - but a solo explorer is not leading anyone.
