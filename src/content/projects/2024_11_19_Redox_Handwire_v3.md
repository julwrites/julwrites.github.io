So, as I previously blogged about, I've been using a [ Redox Handwire keyboard build ](https://tehj.io/blog/projects/2022_01_17_redox_keyboard_builds/). 

As it turns out, it is not so nice to have easily removable microcontroller connections on a keyboard. The jumper cables kept coming off, which was a nightmare for typing.

So I had done a second version, which I didn't write about, because I thought it was too similar to the first. 

Basically all I did was add a small breadboard for the microcontroller to sit on, and which held the connections more steadily. But that was about it. 

Now, even this iteration of Hackie (as my wife and I affectionately named the Redox Handwire) started getting very flaky. Keys would randomly fail, and sometimes just get disconnected. This was very irritating, and eventually got to a point where I decided I needed to address this. 

## New plan

So my new plan for this update of Hackie was two things:

1. I had learned some lessons from the previous rounds of building Hackie. One of the biggest problems I faced was that keys would randomly disconnect, and I suspected it was because the wire connections were coming loose. So, this time I would tightly connect the wires before soldering them. 
2. I realized that a moving part outside of the keyboard meant a lot more problem, so I wanted to be able to fit the microcontroller into the case. 

## Better wire connections

The first part was not so hard, but very tedious. I basically had to wind the wires around each other before soldering them, which was very cumbersome and such fine work.

I also decided to do all the rows at once, which would sit closer to the plate, and therefore could be done first.

I don't know if this will solve all the problems, but I do expect to get fewer of the same sort of issue arising from loose solder.

## Microcontroller placement

I figured the best place to put the microcontroller would be inside the case. This was not so much of a problem, but it did mean I needed some way for the microcontroller to sit securely when plugging in, or removing the cable.

In the end I decided I would just melt a channel into the case, since it was a 3D Printed case.

This turned out okay, and the microcontroller could sit almost flush to the case.

This wasn't the prettiest, but it was quite easily doable, and it worked. 

## Finished v3

So finally I finished all the wiring! This round was a lot neater than previous rounds. I decided to mix wires this time, instead of using only single core wires. Instead, I used some Ribbon cables for connections between the keyboard matrix and the microcontroller, which lent a lot more flexibility when the case is closed.

## Some trouble with QMK

I had a little trouble with QMK too. For one thing, I forgot the steps needed to flash the firmware correctly to both sides. 

As it turns out, I could use QMK Toolbox, but I could not use the `.hex` file compiled by QMK Configurator. That's because I needed `EE_HANDS` defined, and this had to be done in the C code itself. 

But once that as done, I could just flash the EEPROM for left and right hands, and then flash the compiled `.hex`. 

This worked just fine, and I'm now typing this on my new and improved Hackie v3. I do have plans for Hackie v4, but it's still in the works, so I'll share it when it's ready
