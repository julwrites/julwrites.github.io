## Hi, I'm Julian. Welcome to my log. 

And yes, that's not a mistake. This website serves as a log for my various projects as well as my more miscellaneous thoughts, and perhaps in future other writing that I may do. 

I read recently that context is important to understand writing, and I must say I agree. So here's some context. 

## Context

I'm a 90s kid who grew up in [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore), and ever since I can remember, I have had a passion for two things in particular: writing and making. I have developed a host of other interests, but these two in particular have dominated much of my life and career. 

At the time of writing, I am a R&D engineer in a company that develops hardware and software for civil engineering inspection work, and most of my tiertary study and work experience has been in software, and will likely continue to be so in the forseeable future. 

I am married to a Filipino lady (who is also a software engineer), and we have one daughter. We both are Christian, and committed to the vision of Christian Disciple-making in particular.

I hope that provides enough underlying context for anything you may read here

### Enough said, enjoy!
