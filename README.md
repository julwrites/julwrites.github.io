This repository contains my personal landing page, currently hosted using Github Pages on [tehj.io](https://tehj.io)

Previous iterations of this site have been, in order:
- [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)
- Vanilla HTML/JS
- [Vue2/TS](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)
- [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)/[Elm-pages](https://elm-pages.com/)


The current iteration is in [Astro](https://astro.build/)

## Motivations

The purpose of this site have been two-fold since the beginning. 

1. To learn Front-end Web Programming by getting my hands dirty
2. To maintain a personal website/portfolio

## Build instructions

More for myself than for any other reader;

- `git clone` this repository
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm run build` to build the site
- `pnpm run dev` to start the hot-reload server

## Running Labs Locally

To run the labs locally, start the development server with `pnpm run dev`. The labs will be available at the following URLs:

- [Mortgage Calculator](http://localhost:4321/labs/mortgage-calculator)
- [Cortisol Management](http://localhost:4321/labs/cortisol-management)
- [SG Tax Calculator](http://localhost:4321/labs/sg-tax-calculator)
