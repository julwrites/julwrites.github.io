# julwrites.github.io

This repository contains my personal landing page, currently hosted using Github Pages on [tehj.io](https://tehj.io)

Previous iterations of this site have been, in order:
- [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)
- Vanilla HTML/JS
- [Vue2/TS](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)
- [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)/[Elm-pages](https://elm-pages.com/)


The current iteration is in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) as a Web-app

## Motivations

The purpose of this site have been two-fold since the beginning. 

1. To learn Front-end Web Programming by getting my hands dirty
2. To maintain a personal website/portfolio

## Build instructions

More for myself than for any other reader;

- `git clone` this repository
- `yarn` or `npm install`
- `yarn build` or `npm run build` to pre-render pages
- `yarn start` or `npm run start` to start the hot-reload server
