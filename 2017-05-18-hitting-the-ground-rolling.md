So I bought a domain and started to route all my various links to it, and then quickly realized that my previous portfolio and resume and all other profiles weren't very consistent. Time to strip it down. I'm going to try moving my portfolio to a Jekyll based one, along with a possible blog and maybe even someday a wiki. Gollum should work with Jekyll quite well, I think...?
